# 🍏 Concurrent Mobile Factory — Java

A Java application simulating a mobile phone factory using multithreading. Produces multiple mobile models (basic and pro) concurrently,
tracks fabrication times, and calculates total profits while safely managing shared resources.

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ Concurrent Production: Multiple mobile models produced simultaneously.

- 🔒 Thread Safety: Shared lists synchronized to prevent race conditions.

- 🛠️ Configurable Workflow: Different production modes available.

- 📊 Profit Tracking: Calculates fabrication time and total profit per order.

- 🧵 Multithreading Practice: Hands-on learning of Java concurrency.

## 🎯 Purpose

Designed for educational purposes to practice Java concurrency, thread management, and synchronization. Not intended for production use.

## 💻 Technologies

- ☕ Java (compatible with Java 8+)

- 🧵 Threads (Runnable, Thread)

- 🔐 Thread-safe lists
